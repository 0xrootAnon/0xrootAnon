##  About Me

Hi, I’m **KST**,  a passionate **Full Stack Developer** and **Cloud Engineer**.  
I craft fast, responsive, and secure web applications using modern stacks and cloud-native tools.

Currently, I’m focused on:
-  Building my handcrafted **personal portfolio**
-  Mastering scalable full stack & cloud architecture
-  Pushing meaningful projects and open-source work
